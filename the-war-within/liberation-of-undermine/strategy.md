# Vexie Fullthrottle and the The Geargrinders

![vexie-fullthrottle-and-the-the-geargrinders](img/vexie-fullthrottle-and-the-the-geargrinders.png)

## üìú Overview

- **Two phases** that alternate
- **Mostly single target** with occasional cleave
- In **phase one** we fight the **boss** around the room
- In **phase two** the **boss** will shut down for a while and will take **double damage** and we AoE down a bunch of **adds**
- **Lust on phase two**

## üõ°Ô∏è Tanks

- You'll be walking the boss **around the room**
  - On normal difficulty there aren't actually any pools to force you along but we'll walk around for practice
- Your **tankbuster** is **physical damage** with a **phyiscal bleed DoT** and **knockback**
- There are **adds** but I don't think you need to pick them up
  - But test it out

## ü™ñ Raid

### Phase 1

- If you get a **big purple circle** on you, move away from the raid and detonate somewhere by yourself
- If you get a **red arrow** on your head, the boss is going to throw **orange circles** at your feet and you need to **stutter step** around
  - Just don't run into other people or move around too much; try to keep those **orange circles** clustered
- Also in phase one, **a few biker adds** are going to spawn and launch themselves at us
  - Don't get hit by the **bikers** and then **kill them**
  - When the **bikers** are killed they will leave behind their bikes and I need volunteers to jump on those **bikes** and ride them into the **boss**
- For **positioning** let's all stay pretty close and grouped for healing unless you're dealing with something

### Phase 2

- The **boss** will **shut down** for a little while and take **double damage**, so lust it
- Also in phase two a **bunch of adds** will spawn and try to **repair** the boss
  - Kill these adds but also **interrupt** their casts and **stun** them
- Healer CDs in phase two

## ‚úÖ Summary

- If you get a **big purple circle**, move away from the raid
- If you get targeted with a **red arrow** on you, stutter step around and don't run into other people
- Kill the **biker adds** and then **steal their bikes** and ride them into the **boss**
- For **phase two**, lust it, and kill and interrupt and stun the **adds** that spawn

## üíÄ Heroic

- The **big purple circles** on players, Spew Oil, now leaves behind an oil slick which is a big pool of bad
- The **tankbuster** also leaves an oil slick pool
  - We shouldn't need to change our strategy too much, just kite around the edge of the room and drop oil slicks behind us as we go
- The **bikers** get **stunned** if they go over **oil slicks**, so it might be worth trying to **bait the bikers** to gon through a **pool**?

# Cauldron of Carnage

## üìù Preparation

![cauldron-of-carnage](img/cauldron-of-carnage.png)

- Prepare the raid to be split into two teams: **odds and evens**

## üìú Overview

- Mostly **single target**
- For this fight we are going to be splitting up into **two teams**
- **Two bosses**; they don't share a **health pool**
  - We need the bosses to **die at the same time**
- The bosses **cannot be tanked together**
- **Odds** start on **TRex**, **evens** start on **Gorilla**
- The way this fight works is that we **stay with our team** and you fight your **boss**
  - Eventually the **bosses** will go into the centre for an **intermission**
  - During the **intermission** we stay close to our teams; follow your tank, and hit **both bosses** and dodge stuff
  - Once the **intermission** is over, you will be **switching bosses**; so the bosses will be taken back to their positions but your team will change to fight the other boss
- **Lust on pull**
  - _(Lusting during the intermission could also work because of cleave; but there is also lots to dodge which could act against it?)_

## üõ°Ô∏è Tanks

- Your job is just to **tank your boss** and have the boss be in a **good spot**
- There are **no adds** or anything else
- Can you watch your **boss' health pool**, especially when we're at **like 10%**, and coordinate your groups so that the bosses **die at the same time**
- Each boss has a **tankbuster** that you'll want a **defensive** for
- A couple of tips for your **tankbusters**
  - The **Dinosaur tankbuster** throws out **lava tornados** in all directions so make sure you are **alone** at all times; you don't want melee next to you
  - The **Ape tankbuster** is **physical damage** and any unmitigated damage is repeated as nature damage; so nothing special you just want to **mitigate as much as you can upfront**
    - _Spell reflect might work?_

## ü™ñ Raid

- **Stay with your team** at all times
- When you're on the **TRex** side there are **two main things** to know about
  - Occasionally a **big bomb** will spawn; it is a **group soak** so please help soak
  - One person will get targeted by the **TRex** with a **laser beam**; you have a few seconds to **point the boss away**; you must point the boss to **shoot off into nowhere**; we don't want the boss breathing his laser into the **group soak** or into the **Ape team**
- For the **Gorilla** side there are **two main things** to know about
  - One is called **Static Charge** in which you will be given a **bar** on your UI
    - The bar **fills up** if you **move**, and **empties** when you **stay still**
    - You don't want the bar to fill up or it will **stun** you
  - The **second ability** is that everyone on the **Ape side** will be targeted with **constant circles** that you want to dodge
    - That's going to force you to move but, again, you want to minimise your movements so move, stop, move, stop; that's called **stutter step**
    - **Try not to walk towards other people** because they are dealing with their own circles

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Stay with your team; **odds** starting on **TRex**, **evens** starting on **Gorilla**
- When you're on the **TRex** side, help out with the **group soak** and if the boss targets you with a **laser beam** you need to **point him away**
- When you're on the **Ape** side, minimise your movements
  - And when the **blue circles** appear underneath everyone, **stutter step** around
- When the bosses **fight in the middle**; that's the **intermission**; you **dodge stuff** and **hit both bosses** and then you **swap sides**

## üíÄ Heroic

- The **soak** on the **TRex** side leaves behind a **pool**
  - We need to make sure we are baiting the bomb into a good spot and minimise running out of space
- The **TRex** throws out a **circle/DoT** on a bunch of people
  - Spread out and big heals
- On the **Ape** side, **adds** appear and **fixate** on people for **12 seconds**
  - The adds **mustn't touch anyone**
  - Maybe try **snares**, **stuns**, **knockbacks** and **speed boosts**

# Rik Reverb

## üìú Overview

- Single target
- This fight has **two phases** that alternate
- In **phase one** we fight the **boss** while keeping some **pylons** low on energy
- In **phase two** we ignore the **boss** and we move together as a unit to find **safe spots** in the room
- **Lust on pull**

## Phase 1

### ü™ñ Raid

- The **boss** is going to spawn in a couple of **pylons** at called **amplifiers**
  - The **amplifiers** will slowly fill up a **progress bar** and our objective is to make sure they don't fill up or we wipe
  - To **discharge** an amplifier you **go up to it and right click on it**
  - This job is best done by **ranged**, including healers, and the **offtank**
  - Discharging an amplifier puts a stacking debuff on you to discourage like two people doing all of them; we need to rotate people in and out to do it
  - Eventually we **might have like six amplifiers** up at a time and we need a bunch of ranged volunteers to help with dicharging
  - **Discharging** hurts so use a **personal** or **ask for big heals**
- If you get a **blue circle** on you, spread out and stay away from others
  - Also you shouldn't help with **pylons** while you have the **blue circle** because it'll hurt too much
- The other ability is a **blue beam** that is targeted on one person
  - The boss will shoot a **laser** at you so if you get targeted for this **blue beam**, stay still and **let other people dodge you**

### üõ°Ô∏è Tanks

- **No tankbuster**, but the boss' **melee hits** are a **frontal** with a **stacking debuff** so you need to **face him away** and swap after about **four or five stacks**
- **Keep the boss away** from the **amplifiers** because he **empowers** them if he's close
  - But also not too far away because we need to be able to **discharge the amplifiers**
  - Somewhere around 20yd away would be good
- If you are not tanking the boss you can help **discharge the amplifiers**

## Phase 2

- Ignore the **boss**; stay together as a **group**
- The **boss** is going to be casting a **nova** which is **lethal** if it touches you
- In order to survive the **nova**, we need to run to one of the **amplifiers** that has a **big blue circle**
  - The **amplifier** with the **blue circle** is randomly chosen
- There's also **lots to dodge** during this phase
- And we also have to keep an eye on the other **amplifiers** and make sure **none are close to full**

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Ranged, healers and tanks keep the **amplifiers** low on **charge** by clicking on them
- Spread out when we get **blue circles** on us
- If you get targeted for **Sound Cannon**, stay still and let other people move
- In **phase two** follow the team to the **big blue circles** for safety

## üíÄ Heroic

- A bunch of **stationary adds** spawn that start casting a **big cast**
  - Can't let the **cast** go off
  - Just **kill the adds** quickly
  - The adds give you a **haste buff** when you attack them
  - Bring some AoE
- **Discharging an amplifier** now leaves behind a **stacking debuff**, discouraging the same people from doing it over and over

# Stix Bunkjunker

## üìú Overview

- This boss has **one phase** and is mostly **single target** but has some **add AoE**
- The **main mechanic** of this fight is the **boss** is going to spawn **small piles of garbage** all over the place
  - When this happens, a few people are going to be turned into **Rollers**; basically a **ball rolling forward**
  - If you are a **roller**, your job is to collect **garbge** by rolling into it
  - You have a **bar** on your UI to fill up, and so once you are **full** you need to roll into a **big bomb**
  - There will be at least one **big bomb** in the room and if they go off it's a wipe so rolling into the **big bombs** is your priority
  - If there are no big bombs left because other people have dealt with them, then just roll into the boss
  - If you see any **adds** running around, feel free to **run over them**
- As far as I know a few people get randomly selected as rollers and I think it includes **one tank**
- **Lust on pull**

## üõ°Ô∏è Tanks

- When the **adds** come out I think the **Scrapmasters** can't be tanked; they just jump around, but you must collect the **Hyenas**
- His **tankbuster** is called **Demolish** which is a **100% damage taken debuff** which lasts 50 seconds
  - I assume you **swap** on that or swap if one of you becomes a **roller**; I'm not sure

## ü™ñ Raid

- Everyone is going to get **orange circles** on them; you **spread out** for that
  - And when you have an **orange circle**, you must **not walk into any garbage** because it'll catch fire and **pulse AoE damage** on us

## ‚úÖ Summary

- If you are a **garbage roller**, collect garbage and then roll into a **big bomb** or the boss
- When the adds come out, interrupt **Scrapmasters** and AoE everything down
- When you get an **orange circle** on you, spread out and don't walk into any garbage piles

## üíÄ Heroic

- There are these new **adds** called **Bombshells** that guard a garbage pile
  - Everyone needs to help **DPS them down**; at 75% HP, they get off their trash pile
  - Rollers must not roll into these guys ever; so that's a thing to dodge

# Sprocketmonger Lockenstock

## üìú Overview

- **Two phases** that alternate
- **Single target**
- This fight is mostly about **dodging stuff** and working around the **environment**
  - A lot of the time sections of the platform will be unavailable due to electricity or other bad stuff
- **Lust on pull**

## ü™ñ Raid

- In the **first phase** we are fighting the boss and dodging mechanics
- We generally want to stay fairly **clustered together for healing**
- Occasionally the boss is going to **electrify** about **half the room** and we will need to **move accordingly**, so follow the tanks
- The **central conveyor belt** is usually fairly safe
- **The left and right conveyor belts**: you can use them if you need but they might occasionally have **hazards** on them
- If you get a **yellow arrow** on your head it means you'll be dropping a few small **pools**; so for that **stutter step** around in a small area to keep the pools contained; **you don't need to run away** to drop the pools
- Also in **phase one**, the boss will cast **Activate Inventions** which will do one of the three possible things; either you **dodge beams** that are going across the room left to right; or you **dodge rockets** that are firing all over the place; or you'll see these **magnets** on the **centre conveyor belt** and you want to not get sucked into the magnets
- In **phase two** we are going to be thrown by the **boss** to one side of the room and we need to make our way back to the boss while dodging everything

## üõ°Ô∏è Tanks

- The boss' **melee hits** are a **stacking debuff**, which is also a **snare**, so just be aware of your **low movement speed**
- And occasionally he'll strap a bunch of **fireworks** to you and you need to **run away from the raid** to explode; the damage is **falloff**
- Other than that in **phase one** you just need to position the boss well and move the boss when he casts **Wire Transfer** because Wire Transfer means he's electricifying part of the room
- There's nothing special you need to do in **phase two** because the boss is having some downtime; just get to the boss and attack him

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Yellow arrow** on your head means you'll be **dropping pools**; so stutter step to keep them clustered
- When the boss **activates inventions**, you'll either be dodging **beams**, or dodging **rockets**, or avoiding getting sucked into **magnets**
- In **phase two**, find a safe path to the boss by using the **conveyor belts**, use speed boosts and dodge everything

## üíÄ Heroic

- The boss now spawns in **several land mines** around the platform
  - The **land mines** will eventually explode
  - When they explode, they **AoE us all** and put a **2sec debuff** on us, so if multiple go off at once it's a **wipe**
  - What we need to do is **stagger the explosions**
  - **One person** can't do them all because of a **debuff**
  - Therefore, grab **two ranged volunteers** and a tank to detonate them in order, staggered by 2sec per person
  - E.g. Offtank -> Ism -> Salbei -> Leave the last one to detonate
