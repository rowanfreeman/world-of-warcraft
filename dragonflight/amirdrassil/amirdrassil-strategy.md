# Amirdrassil Strategy

## Gnarlroot

### âœ… Preparation

<img src="img/gnarlroot.png" />

- Get **odds/evens** groups ready
- Odds **blue marker**, evens **red marker**
- **Skull** marker at the edge of the room
- If possible, setup a **warlock portal** that goes through the centre of the room

### ðŸ“œ Overview

- **Some AoE**, I recommend talenting a bit of **AoE**
- This fight has **two phases**; those phases are on a **timer** and they **loop**
- In **phase 1** we fight the boss at the edge of the room and occasionally deal with **adds**
- When he gets to **100 energy** he'll move into the **centre** of the room for a **down phase** or intermission where he takes no damage

### ðŸ›¡ Tanks

- Start with the boss on **skull**
- Basic **tankbuster** called **Barrage**
  - He'll channel on you and you'll be hit **five times**
  - Half of it is **physical** and half of it is **spell damage**
  - Each hit is a **stacking debuff**
  - I think just take the whole thing and swap when it's done
- The raid is going to be **dropping big pools** and we might need to **move**; up to you
- Always grab all **adds** that are up - don't let them attack the raid - and tank the adds on the **boss** for cleave
- The boss will occasionally face the raid with a **frontal breath** but that's on us to dodge it; you're not doing anything wrong

### ðŸ¤º Raid

- **Big red circle** on you means you're about to drop a **pool**
  - On **normal** I think we can drop these anywhere that is **safe**; avoid the **centre** of the room
- Dodge the **breath** from the boss and kill **adds**
- For **phase 2** the boss will walk to the **centre** of the room for an **intermission**
  - We are going to split up into two teams: **odds** on **blue**, **evens** on **red**
  - There will be **large tree roots** eminating from the boss
  - The **tree roots** are **impassible** meaning you have to walk around them
  - What we need to do is set the **tree roots** on **fire**
  - You do this by standing in **personal soaks**
  - When you stand in a **soak**, you get **5 stacks** of a **debuff** that you can use to set **tree roots** on fire by just **walking into them**
- Once all **tree roots** are dead, the boss is going to be **stunned** and take **100% increased damage** for **20 sec**, so CDs and lust it
- **Avoid** walking through the **centre of the room** where the boss is during the **intermission**, I think it's **lethal**

### âš• Healers

- I'll use CDs in phase 1
- Healer 2: have a heal ready for the intermission
- Healer 3: have a heal ready for the lust

### ðŸ‘Œ Summary

- In **phase 1**, **drop pools**, dodge breath and kill adds
- In **phase 2**, split up: odds blue square, evens red X
  - Help soak the **individual soaks** and then touch the **tree roots**; avoid running through the boss
- **Lust** one all **tree roots** are dead

### ðŸ’€ Heroic

- Adds are now dormant when they spawn and you have to wake them up with pools
  - Drop your **pool** on **sleeping adds**; the little plants sitting in the ground
  - Dropping your **pools** on **adds** will wake them up and we can kill them
  - Why do we want to wake them up? When adds wake up, **they deal raid damage**
    - When you enter **phase 2**, all dormant **adds** wake up, so if there are too many it could be a **wipe** so we want to wake them up a little bit at a time
- Missing a soak does **raid-wide damage**

## Igira the Cruel

### âœ… Preparation

<img src="img/igira.png" />

- Split raid into three groups, excluding tanks: **yellow**, **green**, **purple**
- Place markers: **blue, green, yellow, purple**

### ðŸ“œ Overview

- This is **one phase** and **mostly single-target**
- The main gimick in this fight is called **torment**
  - Have a look at the **three weapons** in the arena
  - When the boss reaches **100 energy** she will offer us **three torments** and we get to pick one
  - All it means is that when we pick a **torment**, she gains an **ability** that we have to deal with
  - There will be one torment on **green triangle**, one on **purple diamond** and one on **yellow star**
  - The **torments** are just **big red circles** on the ground that we need to stand in to **soak**
    - The **circle** shrinks when we **soak** and once it's **fully soaked**, she gains the ability
  - So, we fight the boss, she gets to 100 energy, we soak a torment, then we return to normal while we deal with that new ability, then a few minutes later she'll get to 100 energy again and we pick the next torment and deal with that and so on
  - We're going to have **group assignments** for soaking the **torments**, so check your group
    - Can I get **group one** go to **green triangle**, **group two** go to **purple diamond** and **group three** go to **yellow star**
  - **Lust** at the **start** unless we run into trouble at the end of the fight

### ðŸ›¡ Tanks

- Tank her where she is is fine
- Her **auto attacks** hit the next closest person just like **Sludgefist** from **Castle Nathria** so you need to **hold hands** otherwise you take **double-hits**
  - This also means be careful not to kill **melee**; yell at them if they get too close
- Her **auto attacks** also apply a **stacking DoT**; my guess would be swap at around **10 - 12** stacks but you'll have to get a feel for it

### ðŸ¤º Raid

- Unless you're dealing with something, our general stack spot is **blue square**
- When you get a **big red circle** on you, the boss is going to throw a **spear** at you
  - It will hurt and you will **tethered** to the spear and you need to **kill it** to break free
  - There is also a **pool of bad** underneath the spear; so melee you can help kill spears but just don't die to the pools
  - Let's **cluster the spears** around the boss and burn them down quickly
- The boss will occasionally face the raid and throw **swords** out, just **dodge them**
  - Do you remember the **Amalgamation boss** in Aberrus? The one with a the **purple void boss** and the **fire boss**?
  - It's just like the fire boss' **tornados**
- Regarding **torments** there are **three possible abilities** that the boss will get
  - When **green team** soaks the torment on **green triangle**, she will gain a **leap ability**
    - It means that occasionally she will **leap** somewhere and we just **dodge it**
- When **purple team** soaks the torment on **purple diamond**, it means we will occasionally get a heal absorb on us
  - It's up to the **healers** to heal through this but maybe throw a **personal heal** on yourself if you can spare it
- When **yellow team** soaks the torment on **yellow diamond**, it means a **split-damage soak** on the **tanks**
  - In order to deal with this group soak, we'll use our groups
  - **Green** team first, then **purple** team second, then **yellow** team third


### âš• Healers

- This fight ramps up a lot towards the end
- It hurts when she casts **Harvest of Screams**
- It hurts when she **leaps** which is called **Smashing Viscera**
- When she casts something called **Heart Stopper** a bunch of people will get an **absorb shield** on them and you need to heal through it
  - A **healer CD** might be worth it

### ðŸ‘Œ Summary

- **Spears**: cluster up near the boss if you're targeted for spears
- **Green team** soak the **first torment** on **green triangle**
- **Purple team** soak the **second torment** on **purple diamond**
- **Yellow team** soak the **third torment** on **yellow triangle**
- **Lust** on pull

### ðŸ’€ Heroic

- Players now get a **debuff** when helping **soak a torment**; but we already handle this in normal by using **groups**
- The **leap torment** now releases **fire swirlies** everywhere to dodge
- The **absorb shield torment** now releases **orbs** to dodge from the player when the shield is removed
  - _During the beta, people pixel-stacked to deal with this, because the orbs have a grace period_
  - Also the player explodes in a 7yd radius so you have to spread out a bit

## Volcoross

### âœ… Preparation

<img src="img/volcoross.png" />

- Get the raid ready for two groups: **odds**, **evens**
  - Odds left, evens right
- Maybe have each group stand together on star/circle or at least left side/right side

### ðŸ“œ Overview

- Classic fight with the stationary boss in the middle
- Single target, single-phase
- For this fight we will be splitting up into two groups: **odds** and **evens** and making our way around the platform
- **Lust** on pull

### ðŸ›¡ Tanks

- Boss' melee stacks a **DoT** on you and it's also a **damage taken debuff** for his **tankbuster** which is called **Cataclysm Jaws**
  - So take a bunch of **stacks**, and then right before the **tankbuster** hits, **taunt swap**
- Other than that, try to be in range of the boss so he doesn't AoE the raid and stick with your group

### ðŸ¤º Raid

- We start grouped up together around **yellow star** and **orange circle**
- If you get a circle on you, it's a **DoT** so just **stay away from others**
- Occasionally the boss' **tail** will cast a shadow over us and then **slap down**; so dodge that
- The big mechanic here is that the boss will create **two big soaks**
  - The first round of two big soaks is one on **yellow star** and one on **orange circle**
  - So **odds** soak **left**, **evens** soak **right**
  - The next two soaks are **purple diamond** and **green triangle**
    - Have a look at where those are and you can see why we need to split up
  - The other markers around the room is other soaks

### ðŸ‘Œ Summary

- **Soak** with your team and then **odds head left** (clockwise) and **evens go right** (counter-clockwise)
- Watch out for the **shadow** of the **tail** and dodge it
- Spread out if you have a circle on you
- **Lust** on pull

### ðŸ’€ Heroic

- When the tail slaps down, a few fire rissoles emanate out left and right; just dodge them
