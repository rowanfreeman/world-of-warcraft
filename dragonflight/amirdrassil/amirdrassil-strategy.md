# Amirdrassil Strategy

## Gnarlroot

### âœ… Preparation

<img src="img/gnarlroot.png" />

- Get **odds/evens** groups ready
- Odds **blue marker**, evens **red marker**
- **Skull** marker at the edge of the room
- If possible, setup a **warlock portal** that goes through the centre of the room

### ðŸ“œ Overview

- **Some AoE**, I recommend talenting a bit of **AoE**
- This fight has **two phases**; those phases are on a **timer** and they **loop**
- In **phase 1** we fight the boss at the edge of the room and occasionally deal with **adds**
- When he gets to **100 energy** he'll move into the **centre** of the room for a **down phase** or intermission where he takes no damage

### ðŸ›¡ Tanks

- Start with the boss on **skull**
- Basic **tankbuster** called **Barrage**
  - He'll channel on you and you'll be hit **five times**
  - Half of it is **physical** and half of it is **spell damage**
  - Each hit is a **stacking debuff**
  - I think just take the whole thing and swap when it's done
- The raid is going to be **dropping big pools** and we might need to **move**; up to you
- Always grab all **adds** that are up - don't let them attack the raid - and tank the adds on the **boss** for cleave
- The boss will occasionally face the raid with a **frontal breath** but that's on us to dodge it

### ðŸ¤º Raid

- **Big red circle** on you means you're about to drop a **pool**
  - On **normal** I think we can drop these anywhere that is **safe**; avoid the **centre** of the room
- Dodge the **breath** from the boss and kill **adds**
- For **phase 2** the boss will walk to the **centre** of the room for an **intermission**
  - We are going to split up into two teams: **odds** on **blue**, **evens** on **red**
  - There will be **large tree roots** eminating from the boss
  - The **tree roots** are **impassible** meaning you have to walk around them
  - What we need to do is set the **tree roots** on **fire**
  - You do this by standing in **personal soaks**
  - When you stand in a **soak**, you get **5 stacks** of a **debuff** that you can use to set **tree roots** on fire by just **walking into them**
- Once all **tree roots** are dead, the boss is going to be **stunned** and take **100% increased damage** for **20 sec**, so CDs and lust it
- **Avoid** walking through the **centre of the room** where the boss is during the **intermission**, I think it's **lethal**

### âš• Healers

- I'll use CDs in phase 1
- Healer 2: have a heal ready for the intermission
- Healer 3: have a heal ready for the lust

### ðŸ‘Œ Summary

- In **phase 1**, **drop pools**, dodge breath and kill adds
- In **phase 2**, split up: odds blue square, evens red X
  - Help soak the **individual soaks** and then touch the **tree roots**; avoid running through the boss

### ðŸ’€ Heroic

- Adds are now dormant when they spawn and you have to wake them up with pools
  - Drop your **pool** on **sleeping adds**; the little plants sitting in the ground
  - Dropping your **pools** on **adds** will wake them up and we can kill them
  - Why do we want to wake them up? When adds wake up, **they deal raid damage**
    - When you enter **phase 2**, all dormant **adds** wake up, so if there are too many it could be a **wipe** so we want to wake them up a little bit at a time
- Missing a soak does **raid-wide damage**

## Igira the Cruel

### âœ… Preparation

<img src="img/igira.png" />

- Make sure groups are ready: **odds and evens**
- Place markers: **blue, green yellow, purple**

### ðŸ“œ Overview

- This is **one phase** and **mostly single-target**
- The main gimick in this fight is called **torment**
  - Have a look at the **three weapons** in the arena
  - When the boss reaches **100 energy** she will offer us **three torments** and we get to pick one
  - All it means is that when we pick a **torment**, she gains an **ability** that we have to deal with
  - There will be one torment on **green triangle**, one on **purple diamond** and one on **yellow star**
  - The **torments** are just **big red circles** on the ground that we need to stand in to **soak**; the **circle** shrinks when we **soak** and once it's **fully soaked**, she gains the ability
  - So, we fight the boss, she gets to 100 energy, we soak a torment, then we return to normal while we deal with that new ability, then a few minutes later she'll get to 100 energy again and we pick the next torment and deal with that and so on
  - We're going to have **group assignments** for soaking the **torments**, so check your group
  - The strategy is: **odds** soak the **first torment** on **green**; then later when the next one comes, **evens** soak on **purple diamond**
  - **Lust** at the **start** unless we run into trouble at the end of the fight

### ðŸ›¡ Tanks

- Tank her where she is is fine
- Her **auto attacks** hit the next closest person just like **Sludgefist** from **Castle Nathria** so you need to **hold hands** otherwise you take double-hits
  - That also means probably a good idea to tank her **not near melee**
- Her **auto attacks** also apply a **stacking DoT**; my guess would be swap at around **10 - 12** but you'll have to get a feel for it

### ðŸ¤º Raid

- When you get a **big red circle** on you, the boss is going to throw a **spear** at you
  - It will hurt and you will **tethered** to the spear and you need to kill it to break free
  - There is also a **pool of bad** underneath you which means **melee** might not be a good choice to help so maybe just **ranged help kill spears**
  - There are **two ways** to deal with this
  - One way is to **spread out** but another way is to **stack spear players** up to cheese it
  - Therefore **big red circle** people **stack up together**; everyone else **dodge**, use **personals** to stay alive and **ranged help kill the spears**

### âš• Healers

- This fight ramps up a lot towards the end
- **Spears** are going to hurt if we're doing the **stack strategy**
- It hurts when she **leaps**

### ðŸ‘Œ Summary

- **Spears**: group up if you're targeted for spears; everyone else get out of the way
- **Odds** soak the **first torment** on **green triangle** while **evens** just chill
- **Evens** soak the **second torment** on **purple diamond** while **odds** chill

### ðŸ’€ Heroic

- Players now get a **debuff** when helping **soak a torment**; but we already handle this in normal by using **groups**
- The **leap torment** now releases **fire swirlies** everywhere to dodge
- The **absorb shield torment** now releases **orbs** to dodge from the player when the shield is removed
  - _During the beta, people pixel-stacked to deal with this, because the orbs have a grace period_
