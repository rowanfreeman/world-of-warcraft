# Vault of the Incarnates Strategy

## Eranog

### ✅ Preparation

<img src="img/eranog-overview.png" />

- Place down a **blue marker** somewhere on the ring that circles around the room
- Place a **red X** just behind the **blue marker**, about 20yd
- The tanks should grab the boss and **kite** the boss around the room, starting on **blue**
- I will need to mark one of the **Collapsing Flames** with a **skull marker** to indicate the kill target
  - We want to **return** to approximately **where we were**
  - From the center of the room, pick the **left-most target** that **doesn't have a shield**

### 📜 Overview

- AKA "Eggnog"
- This is a repeating **two phase** encounter; we alternate between phase 1 and phase 2 on a timer
- This is a mostly **single-target** fight with some **AoE burst**
- In **phase 1** we'll be **grouping up** and walking around the room with the boss
- In **phase 2** we ignore the boss and get encircled by adds and we need to **kill one** to open up a gap
- **Lust** at the start
  - _(We might need to lust at the end on Heroic, because his roar is ramping damage?)_

### 🛡 Tanks

- Bring the boss to the **blue marker** and walk him around the room along the ring
  - The raid will be behind the boss **dropping pools**, so just stay ahead of us
- Your tank mechanic is a **stacking DoT**: **Burning Wound**; switch when you feel it hurts
- The boss occasionally **cleaves** and I think he targets the raid; so if you see the boss face away you haven't done anything wrong
- There will be **imp adds** fixating on the raid; you can ignore those; if you're not tanking you can help damage
- In **phase two** ignore the boss; you can mostly chill, just help the raid

### 🤺 Raid

- **Group up** behind the boss
- If you get an **orange circle** around you, you're about to **drop a pool**
  - Walk backwards and **drop your pool** behind the raid, starting on the **red X marker**
  - Try to **cluster the pools** closely without hurting each other
- Dropping pools also spawn **imps that fixate randomly**; just burn them down quickly
  - Use **snares and stuns**
- For **phase two**, we're going to be **surrounded by adds**
  - The adds **slowly march** towards the center of the room
  - Burn down the one with the **skull marker** to create a gap

### ⚕ Healers

- Zib go first for big heal; use it on Roar; I'll go second
- Nattz big heal for phase 2

### 👌 Summary

- **Group up** behind the boss
- **Drop pools** behind the raid
- **AoE** the adds
- Then in phase 2 we get surrounded by adds; **kill one** to create a gap

### 💀 Heroic

- The boss puts **big spikes** under people
  - They hurt when spawned; dodge them
  - These explode when the boss casts **Incinerating Roar**; dodge red swirlies

## The Primal Council

### ✅ Preparation

- Mark a ranged with **blue marker** (or any)
  - They aren't the ranged stack as such, but ranged should generally try to be close to them

### 📜 Overview

- This is a **single-phase** AoE fight
- We will be taking on **all four bosses** at the same time and they need to all die at the same time
- **Lust** at the start

### 🛡 Tanks

- Pick up **all four bosses**
  - Two of them are **melee** and two of them are **casters**; the casters are probably difficult to move
- Your tank mechanics come from the melee bosses **Firepath** and **Opalfang**
  - **Firepath** cleaves, so face her away and don't both of you get hit by it
  - **Opalfang** applies a **physical damage taken debuff**
  - You'll need to swap these two bosses
- For **positioning**, we're going to be littering the floor with **pools** and **pillars**
  - Avoid the center and take us around the room as needed
- However, try to be not too far from the **pools of fire** and the pillars; the raid needs them close
- Help interrupt the caster bosses **Icewrath** and **Stormlash**
- Can you watch the health of the bosses and tell the raid to DPS if one is falling behind

### 🤺 Raid

- For **positioning**, generally try to be towards the edge rather than the center of the room
- **Melee** prioritise **Icewrath** or **Stormlash**; AoE all of them of course, but target either **Icewrath** or **Stormlash** and keep the interrupts going
- **Ranged** prioritise the other two; **Firepath** or **Opalfang**; AoE as well but for any single target, go with **Firepath** or **Opalfang**
  - Also try to throw out interrupts on the casters **Icewrath** and **Stormlash**
- Also **ranged** try to be **fairly close together**; this fight will generally encourage us to spread out so it's not a fight where we're stacking up, but also don't be too far away
  - And **ranged**, try to not be in the **middle of the room**
- **Big red swirly** will go out on two people, it is **split damage** and it drops a pool, so place your pools not in the middle of the room and everyone else help soak them
  - A side note for the **big red swirly** is that I think it **destroys pillars**
  - We want some pillars to remain standing but if there are too many in our way, we can clear them
- A **blue circle** around you is a **lightning debuff**; it hurts
  - It's also **contagious**; so if you walk near anyone else, they will catch it too and that's bad; so avoid **transmitting** the debuff to others
  - Stay clear of people with the **blue circle**
  - You can cleanse yourself of this **blue circle lightning debuff** by touching a pillar; the pillars show up during the fight (they are spiky rocks sticking out of the ground)

### 🚶‍♂️ Everyone

- One more thing to talk about is **Blizzard**
  - When this goes off, you'll gain stacks of a **slowing debuff**, at **10 stacks** you'll get frozen in ice and we have to break you out to save you
  - Therefore, to avoid this, everyone needs to **cleanse** themselves by stepping into a **pool of fire**
  - So when I call **Blizzard**, step briefly into a **pool of fire**
  - For each person that steps into the pool, it **shrinks**; so just be aware that you might have to switch to another pool one dries up on you

### ⚕ Healers

- Let's try CDs on the **big red swirly soak**
  - Zib first, then Nattz

### 👌 Summary

- Melee prioritise Icewrath and Stormlash and ranged prioritise Firepath and Opalfang
- Big red swirlies means drop pools somewhere good and help soak them because split damage
- Blue circle means spread out and avoid others, and cleanse yourself by going to a pillar
- Blizzard means touch a pool of fire

### 💀 Heroic

- **Conductive Mark** from **Stormlash** lasts 20 sec, up from 10
- The **pillars** created by **Opalfang** now pulse AoE damage
  - We'll probably want to remove some of these using the **Meteor Axe** mechanic, but maybe not all of them? We need some to remove **Conductive Mark**
- The **axes** from **Firepath** debuff you, increasing damage taken from axes
  - I don't think this changes much, because the ability only comes along every ~22 seconds
  - I think this is just to punish anyone that wanted to soak both

## Dathea, Ascended

### ✅ Preparation

<img src="img/dathea-ascended.png" />

### 📜 Overview

- This is **Dathea Stormlash** who we just defeated in the council fight
- We are now above the room of the first boss if you look over the edge
- Note the **three platforms** around the room
- This fight is **single-phase** and mostly **single target**
- In this fight we're going to be taking on the **boss** on this main platform while dodging **swirlies** and **cyclones** and then occasionally jumping up to one of the platforms to deal with an **add**
- This fight involves a lot of **knockbacks** and being knocked into **other people or mechanics** is what will get you
- **Lust** at the start

### 🚶‍♂️ Everyone

- The boss will do a **suck**; it will suck us all towards her; just **run away** and use **speed boosts**
- There are going to be small **tornadoes** wandering around slowly on the platform
  - They are pretty easy to avoid, but the boss will occasionally cast **Crosswinds**, which will fling the tornadoes **across the room** in a random direction
  - Each **tornado** will indicate its direction with a **blue arrow** on the ground, and a **blue swirly** further away on the ground indicates its destination
  - So therefore, for **Crosswinds**, have a look at the tornadoes in the room and don't be in their path
- The boss is going to summon **two adds**
  - One add will be on **this platform**, and the other add will be on one of the **three platforms**: blue, yellow or green
  - When the add dies, it explodes, **knocking everyone** a huge distance
  - Therefore we need to place the **add** near the **upper platform** and use its death to propel us over
  - Then kill the **add** up there, which will knock us back

### 🛡 Tanks

- Tank the **boss** in the centre of the room
- Your **tank mechanic** hits hard and is a **knockback** and a **damage taken debuff**
- One of you will need to be on **add duty** when they spawn
  - The adds spawning is probably a good time to **taunt swap**
  - When they spawn, one of you grab the one that's on this **platform** and take it to the correct **coloured marker**; call out which marker
  - You need to position yourself so that the **knockback** sends you up to the next platform and tank that add
  - That add will also **explode**, so position yourself to come back

### 🤺 Raid

- **Ranged** spread out around the boss
- The same **lightning debuff** mechanic exists from the previous fight
  - So if you get a **blue circle**, stay away from others or you'll infect them
- When the **add** spawns, you need to position yourself so that the knockback sends you over to the next platform
  - Do not attempt to come up to the platform if you have the **blue circle debuff**
  - If you have the **blue circle debuff**, you can remain on this platform

### ⚕ Healers

- We'll need healers on both platforms and I want each of us to have a turn going up
  - Zib goes up first, unless you have blue circle
  - Nattz goes up second, unless you have blue circle
  - Let's try healer CDs on Cyclone which is the boss' suck ability

### 👌 Summary

- Dodge the tornadoes when they dash across the platform
- Position yourself to be knocked on to a platform and then be knocked back down
- Blue circle means avoid others and stay on this platform

### 💀 Heroic

- **Conductive Mark** lasts 15 sec, up from 10
- A bunch of **smaller adds** also spawn on the upper platform
  - They need to be **interrupted** and **AoE'd** down
  - Try interrupts and stuns?
- When adds spawn, it leaves behind a thunderstorm which hurts if you stand under it
  - Either get adds out of it, or it's a job for ranged only?

## Sennarth, the Cold Breath

### ✅ Preparation

<img src="img/sennarth.png" />

- Place a yellow marker slightly on the right for ranged and healers to start

### 📜 Overview

- This is a **two-phase** encounter with a boss and constant adds
- The way this encounter goes is that the **boss** fights from where she is and we make our way up the **stairs** taking on **adds** along the way
- At the **top** she'll go into **phase 2** where she jumps down on to the platform with us and it's a race to the end as a soft enrage approaches
- Lust in phase 2

### 🚶‍♂️ Everyone

- Throughout the fight there are **ice patches** on the ground
  - The **ice patches** cause you to slide around, making it easy to fall off the ledge or run into bad things
- Her **signature ability** is either a **pull** or a **push** mechanic that risks launching you off the ledge
- In order to combat the push, the pull and the sliding, there is also going to be **spider web** on the ground
  - The spider webs are a **snare**
  - Generally you want to avoid **spider webs**, as 10 stacks of it is bad, however getting **one stack** of it helps with sliding and prevents the **push** or **pull** sending you over the edge
  - Therefore, **step into some web** when the big pull or big push is coming

### 🛡 Tanks

- Your tank mechanic from the boss is a **damage taken debuff**, so you'll need to swap
- You need to pick up the **big spider add**
  - It does a **cone AoE** so face it away
  - Tank the **big spider** near the melee but **behind their walking path**
  - What I mean is that the **big spider** also drops ice and we want to **avoid ice** where the melee are about to walk
- There are going to be lots of **small spiders**
  - Try to tank them if you can
  - If you spot anyone **stunned in webbing**, take the small spiders to them
  - The spiders **explode on death** which cleanses the webbing

### 🤺 Raid

- **Melee**, the **boss' hitbox** is pretty big, try to find the limit and stand back from the ledge
- If you get targeted with a **blue circle**, you are about to **explode** so don't be near others
- If you're **dropping web**, try to drop it **in front of the melee** at the **ledge**
- The boss is going to **pull** you in like **deathgrip**
  - **Run back** towards the other ledge and step in **web** to help stay alive
- There are going to be lots of **small spiders** constantly
  - **DoT** them and **AoE** them, although they aren't really your priority
    - Do note that when the **small spiders** die, they explode, which hurts and also dispels the web debuff on you and the web on the ground
    - This means that if the boss is about to **pull** us in, and you stand on some **spider web** to snare yourself, you might think you're safe and then a small spider explodes on you and dispels you, and you get gripped off the ledge
    - It also means that if you have **stacks of web** that you don't want, because of the snare, you can cleanse yourself by standing near a small spider and killing it
- If you are targeted for **Enveloping Webs**, you're going to start **dropping pools** of **spider webs**
  - Try to drop **spider webs** in front of the melee **near their ledge**

### ⚕ Healers

- Let's try CDs for her signature ability which is the push/pull; they're called **Gossamer Burst** and **Repelling Burst**
  - Zib first, then Nattz

### 👌 Summary

- Ice is slippery
- Stepping into spider webs a little bit can help with slipping and the pull and the push
- Small spiders explode
- Blue circle around you means spread out
- Drop web in front of the melee near their ledge

### Phase 2

- In **phase 2**, we're going to fight the **boss** on the **platform** at the top of the stairs
- We can't go back down stairs, and the whole platform is **slippery**
- Her **signature ability** is now a **push**, not a **pull**
  - You need to position yourself so you don't get knocked off a ledge, and remember that standing in **web** will save you
- Your biggest enemy in phase 2 is slippery ice and knockbacks
- We still have the **blue circle debuff** to deal with, but now it also leaves behind a **blue bomb**
  - If you run into a **blue bomb**, it hurts and it's a knockback, so you'll get thrown off the ledge
- To deal with this, I need **ranged** to get to the **back of the platform** once we're at the top for phase 2
- The web debuff continues but it's changed up a little
  - Now, when it ends, it's a **knockback**, so if you get the **Suffocating Webs** debuff, get into a good spot for a knockback so you don't fall down
  - And you also get a **massive snare**
  - You need to be **cleansed** of this snare, so go to an exploding spider; just stand next to a small spider and kill it

### 👌 Phase 2 Summary

- Get to the back of the platform; that's our starting location
- Blue circle means spread and drop bombs
- The web debuff is a knockback and you need to be cleansed
- Her signature is a knockback

### 💀 Heroic

- Getting wrapped up in **webbing** now **stuns** for 30sec, rather than just reducing movement speed
  - This includes in phase 2, where people get hit with **Suffocating Webs**
  - We need to break people out of the stun

## Terros

### 📜 Overview

- This is a **single-target** fight in which **Terros** sits in the center and all of his abilities are about **earth and rock**
- This is a **DPS race** in which the boss will occasionally **eliminate one quater of the room**
  - So we have to kill him before we run out of **floorspace**
- **Lust** at the start

### 🛡 Tanks

- Your tank mechanic is **Concussive Slam**
  - It shoots out like a **laser beam**; it'll hurt and it'll debuff you; probably swap on each one
  - Your objective is to aim this ability at the **spikes** in the raid
  - The **spikes** that are placed by the raid hurt us all and it's up to you to **bowl them over**
- Other than that, help **soak** the **big yellow swirlies**

### 🤺 Raid

- For positioning we'll have a **ranged group** (~25yd) and a melee group
- If you get targeted for a **big yellow swirly**, it is a **split damage** so go to melee and **stack up** and don't run away unless you can immune it; call out if you are
- If you get a **yellow arrow** above you, you're about to **drop a spike**, so drop them in a line behind the **big yellow swirly**
- At **full energy** the boss will cast his **signature ability** which will destroy **one quarter** of the room, so run to the **left**; **clockwise**

### ⚕ Healers

- Let's rotate our CDs on **Concussive Slam** which is when the tanks are destroying rocks, because it hurts and leaves a DoT
  - Zib
  - Nattz
  - Locust

### 👌 Summary

- Two groups, melee in the front and ranged a bit behind
- Big yellow swirly means go to melee and soak
- Arrow on your head means form a line behind yellow swirly and drop spike
- Run left when boss casts massive ability

### 💀 Heroic

- The rubble that falls from ceiling (yellow swirlies) now leaves behind pools
  - It makes positioning harder and more important

## Kurog Grimtotem

### ✅ Preparation

<img src="img/kurog-grimtotem.png" />

- On **Normal**, there is no **penalty** for switching altars; but we should probably pretend there is so that we practice for **Heroic**
- Place a coloured marker at each section
- We will probably go flame -> frost -> storm -> earth
  - This seems to be the order of most difficult to least difficult
  - We have buffs and mana early on, so do the hardest stuff first

### 📜 Overview

- Have a look around the room and notice that it is divided up into **four sections**
- Each section has an **altar** that represents an **element** of either flame, frost, earth or storm
- This is a mostly **single target** fight with **occasional cleave** and it has **three phases**
- **Phases one and two** repeat a couple of times and **phase three** is a burn phase
- In **phase one** we take on the **boss** and deal with abilities that match the **altar** that we are at
- In **phase two** the boss retreats and we deal with **two minibosses**
  - Once we kill the **two minibosses** the fight returns to **phase one** and we repeat
- Lust at the start

### 🚶‍♂️ Everyone

- Let's go over how this fight works
- We need to take the **boss** to one of the **altars**
  - While the boss is at an altar, he gains **abilities** that match that **element**: so at the **flame alter** he'll gain a bunch of **fire abilities**
  - We will visit **all four altars** but we can choose the **order** that we do them in
  - One of the things he does at each altar is **AoE** on the raid every few seconds and that damage ramps up and so that will pressure us to change altars
- After a certain amount of time, the boss will become **immune** and go to the center of the room for **phase two**
  - Two **minibosses** will spawn
  - There are four possible minibosses: flame, frost, earth and storm and we will fight two of them at a time

### 🛡 Tanks

- The **boss** cannot be in the **middle** of the room or it wipes us
- Always **face the boss away** from the raid
- Your tank mechanic from the boss hits hard and is a **knockback** and a **stacking bleed**
- Watch the boss' energy bar; when it reaches half way, it's time to go to the next altar; call it out and move us
- 

### 🤺 Raid

### ⚕ Healers

### 👌 Summary

- Flame altar:
- Frost altar:
- Earth altar:
- Storm altar:

### 💀 Heroic

- **Changing alters** deals big **damage**, and a damage taken **debuff**, discouraging frequent swapping of altars
- Each alter gains a new threat
  - **Fire**: A bunch of **red swirlies** in lines to dodge
  - **Frost**: A bunch of **frost missiles** shoot out from the boss; getting hit hurts a ton and stuns
  - **Earth**: Puts a **healing absorb** on a few people
  - **Lightning**: Puts a **debuff** on a few people
    - When it expires, they take **increased lightning damage** and **pulse lightning damage** to the **closest player**
    - This means that two people with the debuff **should not** be next to each other
    - Instead, I think the strategy should be people without the debuff "save" the people with the debuff by standing next to them
- The **split damage** at the Forst altar applies a debuff
  - At two stacks, you get frozen; this is clearly to discourage stacking both of them on the raid
  - We already separate them: one for melee and one for ranged
- Adds now spawn from the **fire miniboss**
  - Interrupts (and stuns?)
